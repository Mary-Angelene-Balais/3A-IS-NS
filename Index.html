            <p> Hello, I'm Mary Angelene V. Balais, a 20-year-old with a passion for creativity and community involvement. 
                When I'm not pursuing my studies as a 3rd-year college student at the Technological University of the Philippines 
                - Manila Campus, I'm indulging in my hobbies and talents, which include sewing, lettering, crafting, scrapbooking, 
                and singing. Beyond my personal interests, I'm an active server and choir member at Sta. Clara de Montefalco Church, 
                where I find joy in contributing to the spiritual life of our community. I also proudly serve as the Public Relations 
                Officer of the Parish Youth Ministry since 2023. As a Caritas Manila Youth Servant Leadership and Education Program 
                (YSLEP) Scholar since 2021, I'm committed to giving back to society. Additionally, my basic HTML knowledge, gained 
                during my 10th-grade ICT course, reflects my eagerness to embrace new skills and technologies. I look forward to 
                connecting with people and sharing experiences that drive personal growth and community betterment. </p>
